If System.exit(0) was the only way to stop your Hazelcast instance, it means that something in your system was preventing the JVM from shutting down properly. Let‚Äôs debug the possible causes.

‚∏ª

üîç Possible Reasons Why Hazelcast Didn‚Äôt Shutdown Properly

Even after calling instance.shutdown(), Hazelcast.shutdownAll(), or HazelcastClient.shutdownAll(), if the process was still alive, it suggests:

1. Background Threads Keeping JVM Alive

Hazelcast runs several background non-daemon threads that might be keeping the process alive:
	‚Ä¢	IO Threads (Networking, Discovery)
	‚Ä¢	Heartbeat/Monitoring Threads
	‚Ä¢	Executor Services (Scheduled Tasks, Event Listeners)
	‚Ä¢	Cluster Rebalancing Tasks

üõ† How to Detect Hazelcast Threads

Before calling System.exit(0), print all running threads:

Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet()
    .forEach(thread -> log.info("Active Thread: " + thread.getName() + " | State: " + thread.getState()));

Look for any Hazelcast-related threads that are still active.

2. Hazelcast Client Still Connected

If you are using Hazelcast in client mode (HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient()), it may not be shutting down properly.

‚úÖ Fix: Ensure client shutdown explicitly

if (instance instanceof HazelcastInstance) {
    instance.shutdown();
} else if (instance instanceof HazelcastClientInstance) {
    ((HazelcastClientInstance) instance).shutdown();
}

HazelcastClient.shutdownAll();
Hazelcast.shutdownAll();

3. Shutdown Hook Not Triggering

If your shutdown hook is not getting executed on JVM exit, it can leave Hazelcast running.

‚úÖ Fix: Manually add a shutdown hook

Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
    log.info("JVM Shutdown Hook: Stopping Hazelcast...");
    Hazelcast.shutdownAll();
}));

4. Stale Network Connections Preventing Shutdown

If Hazelcast has open network sockets (e.g., TCP connections to other nodes), it can prevent the JVM from stopping.

‚úÖ Fix: Enable aggressive shutdown mode

hazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().terminate();

This forces immediate shutdown without waiting for operations to complete.

5. Force Shutdown Hazelcast Executors

If Hazelcast is running executor services, they might still be active.

‚úÖ Fix: Shut down executors manually

HazelcastInstance hzInstance = instance;
if (hzInstance != null) {
    hzInstance.getExecutorService("default").shutdown();
}

üõ† Debugging Next Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Print all active threads before shutdown

Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet()
    .forEach(thread -> log.info("Thread: " + thread.getName()));

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Hazelcast.getAllHazelcastInstances() is empty after shutdown

log.info("Remaining Hazelcast instances: " + Hazelcast.getAllHazelcastInstances());

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure client and member shutdown separately

instance.shutdown();
Hazelcast.shutdownAll();
HazelcastClient.shutdownAll();

4Ô∏è‚É£ Force terminate if shutdown fails

System.exit(0);

Final Thoughts

üöÄ Since System.exit(0) worked for you, it‚Äôs clear that some Hazelcast threads were still running. Try the debugging steps above to pinpoint the issue.
