If HazelcastInstance.shutdown() is not closing all instances properly, there could be multiple reasons for this behavior. Here are possible causes and solutions to ensure all Hazelcast instances are correctly shut down.

⸻

Possible Causes & Solutions

1. Multiple Hazelcast Instances Running
	•	If multiple instances are running in your application (e.g., created separately), calling shutdown() on one instance will only close that specific instance, leaving others running.

Solution: Shutdown All Instances

Hazelcast.shutdownAll();

✅ This ensures that all running Hazelcast instances in the JVM are shut down.

⸻

2. Shutdown Hook Conflicts

If you’re relying on Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(), it might not be getting executed properly in certain conditions (e.g., force kill, abrupt shutdown).

Solution: Ensure Shutdown Hook is Added

Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
    log.info("Shutting down Hazelcast...");
    Hazelcast.shutdownAll();
}));

✅ This ensures Hazelcast shuts down when the JVM is terminated.

3. Hazelcast Client vs. Member Issue

If you’re shutting down a Hazelcast client, it does not shut down the cluster members. The client only disconnects from the cluster, but the nodes remain active.

Solution: Ensure You’re Shutting Down Members
	•	If running a client:

hazelcastClient.shutdown(); // Only shuts down the client


	•	If running a member:

hazelcastMember.shutdown(); // Only shuts down that member


	•	Best approach: Ensure shutdown on all nodes:

Hazelcast.shutdownAll();

4. Hazelcast Instances Running in Different JVMs

If you have Hazelcast running in different JVMs (e.g., microservices or distributed environment), shutdownAll() only affects the current JVM.

Solution: Use Hazelcast Management Center or REST API
	•	If Hazelcast is deployed across multiple JVMs, use the Management Center or REST API to stop nodes.

Example: Shut down from REST API

curl -X POST http://<hazelcast-node-ip>:5701/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/kill

✅ This ensures nodes across different JVMs are stopped.

⸻

5. Delayed Shutdown Due to Cluster Config

Some Hazelcast configurations (like backups or partition rebalancing) might delay the shutdown process.

Solution: Force Immediate Shutdown

hazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().terminate();

✅ This forces an immediate shutdown, bypassing some of the graceful shutdown steps.

⸻

Final Steps

Try these solutions in order:
	1.	Call Hazelcast.shutdownAll() – Ensures all local instances shut down.
	2.	Check if instances are clients or members – Ensure you’re shutting down the right type.
	3.	Use a shutdown hook – Ensures proper shutdown on JVM exit.
	4.	Check if instances exist in different JVMs – If so, use REST API or Management Center.
