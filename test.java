From the error message on your screen, it looks like your Helm installation failed while upgrading or installing the release s2bsec-id-exp. Here are a few possible reasons and steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check Helm Release Name and Namespace
	•	Ensure that the release name s2bsec-id-exp is correctly defined and does not already exist in an invalid state.
	•	The namespace seems to be t****.s2bsec-2b-security. Check if this namespace exists using:

kubectl get ns


	•	If the namespace doesn’t exist, create it:

kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>



2. Debug Helm Install Command
	•	Try running the Helm install command manually with debug mode:

helm upgrade --install s2bsec-id-exp $ABSD//s2bsec-id-exp -n <namespace> --debug


	•	If there’s an issue with ABSD variable expansion, try replacing it with the actual Helm chart path.

3. Validate the Helm Chart
	•	Run:

helm lint /path/to/helm/chart


	•	If there are errors, fix them before re-running the pipeline.

4. Check Kubernetes API Server Connectivity
	•	Ensure that your cluster is accessible:

kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes


	•	If you can’t connect, there may be networking issues.

5. Inspect Helm Logs
	•	Check Helm release status:

helm list -n <namespace>


	•	If the release exists in a FAILED state, delete and reinstall:

helm delete s2bsec-id-exp -n <namespace>
helm upgrade --install s2bsec-id-exp <chart-path> -n <namespace>



6. Verify Helm Version Compatibility
	•	Run:

helm version


	•	Ensure your Helm version is compatible with the chart.

Try these steps and let me know what errors you get.
