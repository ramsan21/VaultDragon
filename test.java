Performance Goals for UAS, TMX, and Catalyst Applications

Description:
	1.	Catalyst Setup & Deployment
	•	Implement Catalyst for UAAS applications in VM, SKE, and AKS.
	•	Streamline the ADO pipeline deployment across OCP, AKS, and SKE to manage the code on a single branch.
	2.	Application Stability & Maintenance
	•	Ensure application enhancements and maintenance tasks are completed on schedule.
	•	Minimize downtime by following a blue-green deployment approach when rebooting services.
	3.	Change Management & Deployment Best Practices
	•	Ensure zero issues related to changes through rigorous validation.
	•	Avoid manual deployments by automating the deployment process.
	•	Verify all technical changes with SIT, UAT, and Technical Validation before deployment.
	4.	Training & Compliance
	•	Attend and complete technical training sessions.
	•	Ensure no timesheet exceptions to maintain compliance.

Measures of Success:
	1.	Successful Catalyst Implementation
	•	Complete Catalyst setup for VM, SKE, and AKS within the defined timeline.
