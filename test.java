Perfect 👍 thanks for showing me your logs.
From the screenshots I see:
	•	Each line is a JSON object ({"@timestamp":"...","message":"..."...}).
	•	The field is called @timestamp, not timestamp (so .timestamp will be null).
	•	Messages contain escaped \n inside the string, so you want those expanded into newlines.
	•	You want:
	1.	Filter logs between two timestamps.
	2.	Show both @timestamp and message.
	3.	Format messages so \n becomes a real line break.

✅ Example jq one-liner

jq -r --arg start "2025-09-11T00:00:00+08:00" --arg end "2025-09-11T00:30:00+08:00" '
  select(."@timestamp" >= $start and ."@timestamp" <= $end)
  | "\(.["@timestamp"])  \(.message | gsub("\\n"; "\n"))"
' uaasv2log.json

🔎 Explanation
	•	."@timestamp" → access the key with @ in its name.
	•	--arg start ... --arg end ... → pass your time range into the filter.
	•	select(... >= $start and ... <= $end) → filters only logs in that window.
	•	\(.["@timestamp"])  \(.message ...) → prints timestamp and message.
	•	gsub("\\n"; "\n") → replaces literal \n in JSON strings with actual newlines.

📌 Example output (formatted)

2025-09-11T00:00:01.239463442+08:00  Inbound Message (SecureLoggingInInterceptor)
**BEGIN MonitorServiceImpl:healthCheck **
...

👉 Do you also want to group the filtered logs by thread_name (since I saw "thread_name":"http-nio-..." in the second screenshot), or just list them in time order?
